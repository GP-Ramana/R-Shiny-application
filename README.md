# R-Shiny-application
I created this application (code in the master branch) after I learning how to use R Shiny through an online course in Udemy. The app is deployed on shinyapps.io. Here is the link: https://grishmaprs1809.shinyapps.io/ppnr/. I have mainly tested it with the popular datasets, Boston Housing (for regression) and Heart Diseases (for classification), both available online.
